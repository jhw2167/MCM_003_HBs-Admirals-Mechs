GRADLE IS DUMB AND VERY BAD
- two plugins with the same "configuration" somewhere cannot be apart of the same project
- so I cannot use 'loom' to remap geckolib to the mojang mappings
- therefore my common dir (dependent on a compileOnly instance of the fabric compiled code) is referencing bad fabric mappings

- therefore, cloned geckolib and compiled core instance locally, for flatDir compileOnly work
- this works because geckolib is entirely multiloader, all classes are identical for forge/fabric instance at runtime


1. Add living entity to Forge/Fabric

1. Add entity type extending geckolib stuff
2.
